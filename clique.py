"""
A clique in a graph is set of nodes such that there is an edge between any two distinct nodes in the set. It is well
known that finding the largest clique in a graph is a computationally tough problem and no polynomial time algorithm
exists for it. However, you wonder what is the minimum size of the largest clique in any graph with N nodes and M edges.

Input Format
The first line contains T the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain 2 integers : N, M
